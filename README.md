### 1. Bode Plots of a series RLC Circuit

This project was used as an introduction to RLC circuits and Bode Plots. This project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ninoc0/Research/blob/main/Bode_Plots_of_RLC_Circuit.ipynb) but is best viewed on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oH9CbiHUOjwKHZz1htCmLJlPnEDvaZry?usp=sharing).

### 2. Curve Fit of Various Circuits

Following up from my first project, I continued on to build these circuits and get experimental data. I curve fit all of this data and included the relevant math. For my best curve fitting work, take a look at the resonant gain filter which also includes residuals plots.

#### a. Notch Filter

### 3. Modeling Closed and Open Loop Gain of an OpAmp(WIP)

In order to gain a better understanding of OpAmps, I am testing the "test plots" in the opamp(AD829)'s data sheet in order to confirm it is working as expected.
Work in Progress.

### 4. Modeling the Transfer Function and Noise of an "Anti-Boost" Fitler(WIP)

Work in Progress.
