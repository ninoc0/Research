### 2. Curve Fit of Various Circuits

Following up from my first project, I continued on to build these circuits and get experimental data. I curve fit all of this data and included the relevant math.

### 3. Modeling Closed and Open Loop Gain of an OpAmp(WIP)

In order to gain a better understanding of OpAmps, I am testing the "test plots" in the opamp(AD829)'s data sheet in order to confirm it is working as expected.

This project was used as an introduction to RLC circuits and Bode Plots. This project is best viewed on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oH9CbiHUOjwKHZz1htCmLJlPnEDvaZry?usp=sharing).
